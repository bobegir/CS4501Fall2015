# CS4501Fall2015
Our project is going to be a marketplace to replace existing ride sharing systems on Facebook. The system will allow drivers to post when and where they are driving, and allow others to search the available rides (by time and destination). Once they’ve found a post, they can view the page for it, allowing them to view further details and submit a bid to ride. Drivers can post a recommended amount of gas money, and riders can bid higher or lower. The driver can accept riders at their leisure. All users will have a profile with a rating, to help users avoid riders or drivers that aren’t courteous, won’t hold up their end of the bargain, etc. Depending how much time we have, we may add additional features like: intelligently matching redundant postings to reduce the number of drivers needed, allowing groups to make bids or drivers to demand some minimum number of riders, and messaging services.
